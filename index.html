      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Matthew Hagan, I study Quantum Computing as a Ph.D student at the University of Toronto with Nathan
        Wiebe. My
        research has focused mainly on simulating quantum systems on quantum computers, with some side projects in
        quantum information theory and error correction. Prior to my phd I worked at Sonos as an embedded systems
        engineer and studied Physics (Course 8) and Math w/ Computer Science (Course 18C) at MIT.

      <h1>Papers</h1>
      <p>
        Below are the papers I have contributed to in reverse chronological order.

          <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00642">Interpreting Multipartite Entanglement through Topological
            Summaries</a>
          <p>A recent line of research has emerged that attempts to characterize multipartite entanglement, a
            generalization of bipartite entanglement, using tools from Topological Data Analysis (TDA). This allows us
            to bring the powerful tools of homology to characterize entanglement among multiple subystems. The main
            results of this paper are a connection between previous notions of "average bipartite entanglement" and the
            integrated Euler characteristic, which is a homological quantity, as well as a characterization of
            stabilizer states that are locally equivalent to GHZ states in terms of their topological fingerprint. I'm
            interested in taking these techniques and trying to apply them to product formula errors, tensor networks,
            or systems with area laws. Another idea is to determine if good algorithms exist to detect homological
            entanglement properties.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03410">The Thermodynamic Cost of Ignorance: Thermal State Preparation with
            One Ancilla Qubit</a>
          <p>
            This is my take on the problem of preparing thermal states on a quantum computer. Inspired by the <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_Monte_Carlo">Hamiltonian Monte
              Carlo</a> classical
            sampling algorithm, this paper shows how coupling a system to a single ancilla qubit via a random matrix can
            lead to a thermal fixed point on the system. We do this by mapping the quantum dynamics to a classical
            Markov chain over the systems eigenbasis. This can be done even if one has no knowledge of the spectrum
            of the system and even further we can characterize the asymptotic runtime of this algorithm in the extreme
            scenarios where one knows the system's spectrum completely and when one has no knowledge.

        <li>
          <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16572">Composite QDrift Product Formulas for quantum and classical
            imulations in real and imaginary time</a>
          <p>This paper extends previously developed composite or partially randomized simulation methods to imaginary
            time. This makes it a useful algorithm for classical Monte Carlo algorithms, which are traditionally based
            on Trotter-Suzuki formulas. This paper also constitutes the first numerical study for the empirical
            improvements of Composite channels and we find that Trotter and QDrift channels can be 18x more expensive
            than Composite methods for specific simulations.</p>

          <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06409v3">Composite Quantum Simulations</a>
          <p>This paper combined randomized simulation techniques (QDrift) with deterministic techniques (Trotter
            formulas) to reduce simulation costs for Hamiltonians with strongly decaying terms.</p>

      <h1>Software</h1>
      <p>
        I've worked on a good chunk of code in my free time, below are some of the projects that have made it to a
        presentable state. Each are in varying levels of progress.
      <ul id="software_libraries">
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/matthagan15/Trotter-Qdrift-Simulation">Trotter-Qdrift-Simulation</a> - A library
          developed alongside my collaborator <a href="https://github.com/mattp97"> Matthew Pocrnic </a> for
          benchmarking composite / partially randomized quantum simulations.
        </li>
        <li> <a href="https://github.com/matthagan15/mhgl">(MHGL)</a> Matt's HyperGraph Library - A library for working
          with undirected hypergraphs that can compute boundaries, links, stars, and skeletons.Currently working on
          adding
          homology algorithms and a simplex-tree datastructure. Documentation can be found <a
            href="https://docs.rs/mhgl/latest/mhgl/">here</a>.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/matthagan15/hdx_codec">HDX_CODEC</a> - Library developed to explore the error
          correcting codes developed in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15563">New Codes on High Dimensional
            Expanders</a> and possible quantum
          counterparts. The most polished functionality it provides now is a breadth-first search traversal of the coset
          complexes associated with finite field matrix groups. As this involves linear algebra over huge (millions of
          rows and columns) and incredibly sparse (each row and column has at most ~3 nonzero entries) matrices, I am
          currently working on spinning off the linear algebra functionality into it's own library. For instance, basic
          gaussian implementation is anywhere from 4x to 300x faster in this library compared to the only comparable
          python library <a href="https://mhostetter.github.io/galois/latest/">Galois</a>.
